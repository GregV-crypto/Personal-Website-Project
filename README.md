# Personal-Website-Project
Custom built website using JavaScript, HTML and CSS as a starting point. - January 2022
The branch I've created is the end of the original website project I decided to create. The only code to be added so far has been an author page. I feel as though I can create a much more complex website than with only vanilla JS. As such, the project will be expanded upon. For transparency sake I find it important to make the project public, and continue to document what I learn and use as time goes on.
