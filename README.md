# Personal-Website-Project
Custom built website using JavaScript, HTML and CSS as a starting point. 
1/24/22 - The point of this website is to be a benchmark to my progress as a web dev...which hopefully will be the first of many different career interests in the Comp Sci field.
The website will be broken up into a multitude of different pages.

# Front page
1/24/22 - Relatively self-explanatory, the front page is what any user will see first, and will be the hub that leads to all other pages. Starting off, the website will have basic functionality. However as my skills in JS, HTML and CSS improve, I'd like to add more artistic features to make the website stick out more. Anybody with a little bit of interest and passion can create a website. But I'd like mine to stick out above the rest. 

# Personal List
1/24/22 - This page as one might have guessed refers to the list of assets a user enters into the website at any given time. The idea is to use local storage as a means to keeping whatever the user types even after refreshing the page(similar to a cookie, but on a larger scale). I'm not sure how big this website will be, so of course if it picks up steam, that form of data storage will have to change.

# All Asset Pages - Stocks, CryptoCurrencies, Forex, Options.
1/24/22 - All of these pages are meant to reflect/mirror the way a conventional app, say Coinbase, Forex.com, or Robinhood show data to their users. The idea is to use the JavaScript fetch API in order to accomplish this goal, and of course one of the many JS frameworks to stream line it if possible.
